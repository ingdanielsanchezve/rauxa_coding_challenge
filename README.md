## Description of the problem.
Create a service that allows for a user to search for a GitHub username. On a successful search return, display the user's GitHub handle, follower count, and a list of the user's followers, Additionally for users with many followers Create a "load more" button that, when clicked, fetches the next payload of followers. 

## Solution
For the solution of this coding challenge, the laravel framework for the backend was used since it is a very popular php framework that could also be used to manage the routes of the API endpoints and to create tests to test the application.

As for the connection with GitHub, a controller was created which makes requests to the API using authentication by means of the user name and the token that must be established in the .env file of the application.

The search of the user is done from the application by means of an asynchronous request which performs the search in 2 phases. first the information of the corresponding user is obtained and later the followers of the user.

Depending on the number of followers of the user proceeds to perform the pager that is displayed in the interface because the API of GitHub returns maximum 30 followers in each request.

In case the user has more than 300 followers, a button is added at the end of the pager to show the additional followers since in this way the interface is maintained.

For each GitHub user their avatar, name, username, bio, location and url are displayed.

Each followers is shown on a contact card where you can see your username, avatar and 2 buttons, one to perform the search of that user within the application and another to see the profile on the site
